        <h1>How Our Platform Works</h1>
        <p>Our platform is designed to make connecting with your community and finding or offering assistance simple, seamless, and accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Here's how it works:</p>

    <section id="step-1">
        <h2>Step 1: Sign Up or Log In</h2>
        <p>Start by creating an account or logging into your existing one. It’s quick and easy! Once you're in, you’ll have full access to all the features that help you find or offer tasks. The platform is fully accessible, with features designed to support users with disabilities.</p>

    </section>
    
    <section id="step-2">
        <h2>Step 2: Post or Browse Tasks</h2>
        <p>If you need help, simply post a task. Describe what you need assistance with and your preferred location. You can also specify if you need a disability-friendly task, ensuring that helpers with experience and skills in accessibility are matched with you. If you want to help others, browse available tasks and choose one that fits your skills, including those tailored for users with disabilities.</p>

    <section id="step-3">
        <h2>Step 3: Match with the Right Person</h2>
        <p>Our smart Task Matching System ensures that you are paired with the right person based on their skills, preferences, and availability. This includes matching those who require disability-friendly tasks with helpers who are equipped to assist with specific needs, whether it’s mobility assistance, visual or hearing impairment, or other forms of support.</p>

    <section id="step-4">
        <h2>Step 4: Get the Job Done</h2>
        <p>Once matched, it's time to get to work! Whether you're helping someone with a task or receiving help, the platform makes it easy to stay connected, track progress, and communicate effectively. Tasks are designed to be accessible, with features such as voice commands, text-to-speech, and other accessibility tools to ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, can participate fully.</p>

    <section id="step-5">
        <h2>Step 5: Rate & Review</h2>
        <p>Once the task is completed, rate and review your experience. This helps others make informed decisions and ensures that the platform continues to offer high-quality, inclusive services to all users. Reviews also help highlight the best disability-friendly helpers, so that others in need of similar assistance can find them easily.</p>
